# Exif Glory Plugin for Craft CMS

Plugin to store exif data with every saved asset

## Installation

To install Exif Glory, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `exifglory` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `exifglory` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Exif Glory works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
